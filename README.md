## What it does

Point the agent at a folder of course materials. It will:

1. **Read every slide deck and lab notebook** (PDFs, PPTX, .py, .ipynb).
2. **Extract atomic concepts** — every named technique, algorithm, metric, or method becomes its own note. *Smoothing* → six notes (Laplace, Add-k, Good-Turing, Kneser-Ney, Interpolation, Backoff). *Attention* → six notes (Scaled Dot-Product, Multi-Head, Self, Cross, Masked, Sinusoidal).
3. **Build a linked vault** with three layers:
   - **Atomic concept notes** — one concept per file, definition callout for hover preview, worked numerical example, ELI5 analogy, flashcards.
   - **Lecture study sheets** — per-lecture narrative walkthroughs with TL;DR, sections matching the slide deck, and 8–12 potential exam questions.
   - **Lab study sheets** — Python pattern walkthroughs, key library functions, gotchas, expected outputs.
4. **Cross-link aggressively** — every concept is wikilinked to related concepts. Average vault has 3,000–5,000 wikilinks across 400–600 notes.
5. **Configure Obsidian** — graph view colour-coded by folder path, hover preview enabled, recommended plugins listed.
6. **Build oral-exam tools** — `Tables.md` with comparison tables and an "elevator pitch bank" for every key concept.

The output: a vault you actually want to open at 2 AM the night before an exam.

## Why this exists

Most students take notes as they go. By exam season, those notes are scattered across PDFs, Notion pages, Google Docs, and handwritten pages. The information is *there* — it's just not retrievable under stress.

This agent inverts the workflow: take the same source material everyone else has (slides, labs, textbooks) and produce a knowledge graph optimized for recall. Hover over any wikilink → see the definition. Cmd+O → jump to any concept. Open the graph view → see how concepts cluster. Open `Tables.md` → recite the elevator pitch for every classifier the night before the oral exam.

---

## Example output

After running across four full courses (NLP, ML, Predictive Analytics, Digital Platforms), the resulting Obsidian graph view looks like this:

![Graph view of a 4-course vault built by vaultcraft](examples/screenshots/graph-view-example.png)

**What you're looking at:**
- Each colour cluster is one course (path-based colouring — no tag pollution)
- ~640 atomic notes across 4 courses, ~4,700 wikilinks holding them together
- Red dots: cross-course bridge notes in `_Shared/` connecting concepts across courses (e.g., *AIC/BIC* shared between PA and ML)
- White dots: lecture / lab study sheets — they sit at the centre of each course's concept cluster because every concept they introduce links back to them
- Smaller dots on the periphery: leaf concepts (definitions, formulas) referenced once or twice
- Larger dots in the middle of clusters: hub concepts (e.g., *Transformer*, *ARIMA*, *Logistic Regression*) referenced from many other notes

This is what semantic structure *looks like* — clusters emerge naturally from how concepts are wikilinked, not from any manual layout.

### Tables.md — the oral-exam cheatsheet

Every vault gets a `Tables.md` at root with comparison tables for the major dimensions of the course. Each row has a **"Say this"** column — a one-sentence elevator pitch you can recite verbatim during an oral exam.

![Tables.md comparison example: classifiers — Naive Bayes vs Logistic Regression vs SVM](examples/screenshots/tables-comparison.png)

Read the *"Say this"* column the night before an exam, and you have a confident opening sentence for any question about that comparison.

After running on a typical single course (12 lectures + 9 labs):

```
my-course/
├── 00 — Start Here.md               ← entry MOC
├── Tables.md                         ← oral-exam comparison tables
├── Lectures/   12 study sheets        ← TL;DR + narrative + exam Qs
├── Concepts/  ~150 atomic notes       ← hover-friendly definitions
└── Labs/        9 Python walkthroughs
```

Each concept note has:
- 1-sentence definition (hover preview shows it without clicking)
- Intuition (plain English)
- Worked numerical example
- "Simple explanation (ELI5)" — analogy with everyday objects
- Wikilinks to related concepts
- Flashcards for spaced repetition

See [`docs/examples.md`](docs/examples.md) for sample notes.

## Installation

You need [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) installed.

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/MikolajSapek/vaultcraft.git
cd vaultcraft

# 2. Copy the agent into your Claude Code agents folder
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
cp agents/vaultcraft-builder.md ~/.claude/agents/

# 3. (Optional) Copy templates if you want to author notes manually too
mkdir -p ~/Documents/ObsidianVaults/_templates
cp templates/*.md ~/Documents/ObsidianVaults/_templates/
```

The agent is now available to Claude Code. Invoke it like:

```
> I have lecture slides for my NLP course in ~/Downloads/.
> Build me an exam-ready Obsidian vault at ~/Documents/ObsidianVaults/NLP/.
```

Claude Code will recognize the task and spawn the `vaultcraft-builder` sub-agent. On first invocation it prints a banner so you know the agent is alive:

## How to use

The agent always runs **Phase 1 — Intake** first, asking nine quick questions before touching any files. Answer them, the agent restates the plan, you confirm, and it runs.

### Intake form

**Context** — what the agent needs to understand the material

| # | Field | Expected answer |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Course | Name, university, level (BSc/MSc/PhD), semester |
| 2 | Purpose | Written exam · oral exam · term paper · daily reference · interview prep · making hard material approachable |
| 3 | Priority topics | Must-know vs. nice-to-have |

**Exam** — what you're optimising the vault for

| # | Field | Expected answer |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | Exam format | Test · essay · project · oral · coding |
| 5 | Exam date | Drives pacing suggestions in the MOC |

**Format** — how the agent should write

| # | Field | Expected answer |
|---|---|---|
| 6 | Lecture format | **Study Sheet** (400–750w, scannable) **·** **Detailed Notes** (1,200–2,500w, narrative — default) |
| 7 | Depth | **lean** (~40% cheaper) **·** **standard** (default) **·** **thorough** |

**Inputs and outputs** — paths the agent should work with

| # | Field | Expected answer |
|---|---|---|
| 8 | Vault path | Where to build the vault, e.g. `~/Documents/ObsidianVaults/my-course/` |
| 9 | Source files | Paths to PDFs · PPTX · .py · .ipynb · textbook excerpts |

### Typical run time

| Course size | Time on Sonnet | Time on Haiku |
|---|---|---|
| Light (5–7 lectures, no labs) | ~15 min | ~8 min |
| Standard (10–12 lectures + labs) | 30–60 min | 15–30 min |
| Heavy (16+ lectures + many labs) | 60–120 min | 30–60 min |

The agent uses **3-tier model routing** — Haiku for mechanical writing, Sonnet for synthesis, Opus only for hard reasoning (novel ELI5 analogies, ambiguous concept extraction). Full decision flow lives in Principle 18 of [`agents/vaultcraft-builder.md`](agents/vaultcraft-builder.md).

See [`docs/usage.md`](docs/usage.md) for example prompts and full workflow.

## Skills the agent uses

The agent calls Claude Code skills to handle Obsidian-specific syntax and supplementary research. Four are bundled in `skills/`; six others are optional and the agent gracefully falls back if they're missing.

### Bundled (recommended install — copy to `~/.claude/skills/`)

| Skill | Purpose | When the agent invokes it |
|---|---|---|
| `obsidian-markdown` | Valid Obsidian Flavored Markdown — wikilinks, embeds, callouts, properties, frontmatter | Any time the agent writes a note (avoids syntax mistakes) |
| `obsidian-bases` | Generate `.base` files (Obsidian Bases — filterable database views) | Phase 7, when building the optional Study Dashboard |
| `obsidian-cli` | Bulk vault operations (rename, move, link verification) | Optional, used when doing >20 file operations in one pass |
| `json-canvas` | Generate `.canvas` JSON Canvas files (visual concept maps) | Phase 6, optional Course Map |

### Optional (not bundled — install separately if you want full functionality)

| Skill | Purpose | When the agent invokes it |
|---|---|---|
| `defuddle` | Clean markdown extraction from web pages | Phase 2, when supplementary web research has noisy HTML (ads, nav, comments) |
| `deep-research` | Multi-source research with synthesis (firecrawl + exa MCPs) | Phase 2, when a concept is under-explained in slides and needs >2 sources |
| `exa-search` | Neural search via Exa MCP | Phase 2, when finding a specific paper or reference implementation |
| `docs` | Context7 documentation lookup for libraries | Phase 5, when generating lab notes that use unfamiliar libraries (verifies API signatures) |
| `iterative-retrieval` | Progressive context retrieval for very long PDFs | Phase 2, only for >100-page PDFs |
| `context-engineering` | Meta-skill for agent context optimisation | Rare — only if the agent thrashes on setup |

**The agent works without any of these skills.** Skills speed things up and reduce mistakes; they are not strict dependencies. See [`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md) for full install instructions and fallback behaviour.

## The crafting pipeline

vaultcraft thinks of vault generation as a Minecraft-style crafting workflow. Internally the agent runs nine numbered phases — here's the themed map of what each one does:

| Phase | Themed name | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 🗺 **Site survey** | Detect whether you're starting a new vault, adding to one, or resuming an unfinished build |
| 1 | 📜 **Recipe selection** | Ask 9 intake questions: course, exam format, depth, sources, language |
| 1.5 | ⚖️ **Budget & blueprint** | Estimate tool budget and write `.vault-progress.md` so runs are resumable |
| 2 | ⛏ **Mining** | Read every PDF/PPTX/notebook and extract the full inventory of named concepts |
| 2.5 | 🏗 **Foundation** | Bootstrap `.obsidian/` config — graph colours, hotkeys, CSS, plugin recommendations |
| 3 | 🧱 **Layout** | Plan and propose the folder structure |
| 4 | 💎 **Forging concepts** | Generate atomic concept notes — one crystal per concept, all linked |
| 5 | 📚 **Crafting study sheets** | Build per-lecture and per-lab notes that link back to concept crystals |
| 6 | 🗺 **Cartography** *(low priority)* | Optional JSON Canvas course map |
| 7 | 🧭 **Hub & beacon** | Build the entry MOC + `Tables.md` for oral exams |
| 8 | 🔎 **Inspection** | Quality pass: broken links, depth check, orphans, hover-preview verification |

You don't need to know the phase names to use vaultcraft — but the agent announces each one as it runs so you always know what's happening.

## Conventions baked into the agent

The agent enforces these conventions across every vault it builds:

- **Atomic notes** — one concept per file, never two.
- **Hover-visible definitions** — definition callout is the FIRST content after the H1, so Obsidian's hover preview shows it without clicking.
- **Worked examples mandatory** — every formula gets actual numbers; every theoretical concept gets a concrete scenario.
- **ELI5 for hard concepts** — math-heavy and abstract concepts get a *"Simple explanation (ELI5)"* section with an everyday-object analogy.
- **Wikilinks not hashtags** — topical clustering happens via `[[wikilinks]]`. Tags are folder-level classifiers only (`concept`, `lecture`, `lab`, `moc`).
- **Path-based graph colours** — graph view is coloured by folder, not by tag, so it stays clean.
- **Comparison tables for oral exams** — `Tables.md` with "Say this" elevator-pitch column.
- **Token economy** — agent delegates mechanical writing (Phase 4 atomic notes, Phase 5 study sheets) to a sub-agent with `model: haiku` to save ~60% of tokens.

See [`docs/conventions.md`](docs/conventions.md) for the full spec.

---

## Limitations

- **Source quality matters.** If your slides are pure bullet-point outlines, the agent has less to extract. Detailed lecture decks produce better vaults.
- **PPTX requires LibreOffice** for conversion (`soffice --headless --convert-to pdf`) — install it for any vault that includes `.pptx` slides.
- **Claude Code only.** The agent is built for Claude Code's agent system. Porting to other agent frameworks would need rewriting the orchestration layer.
- **Math notation in PDF.** OCR on scanned slides loses LaTeX. Agent works best on natively-digital PDFs/PPTX.
